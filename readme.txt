### About TrustedSite Reviews

As you can tell by our name, at TrustedSite we're all about trust for websites. We first brought you the [McAfee SECURE trustmark](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mcafee-secure/), which shows visitors your online store is safe. Now we're bringing you another vital trust-building tool: verified customer reviews.

It won't come as a surprise that reviews are critical to building trust with your store's new visitors. In fact, 88% of people trust reviews as much as personal recommendations.\*

By choosing third-party verified reviews, you'll show your visitors that they can trust your reviews, and trust your store to deliver on its promises. When that happens, your past customers sell your future customers, and your business grows.
